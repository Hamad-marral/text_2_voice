# Text to Voice with Python using gTTS and os

This Python script demonstrates how to convert text to speech using the `gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech) library and the `os` module for playing the generated audio file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `gTTS` library
- `os` module

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/\Hamad-marral/text_to_voice.git
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install gTTS
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the `text_to_voice.py` script in your preferred code editor.

2. Modify the `text` variable to contain the text you want to convert to speech.

3. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python text_to_voice.py
    ```

4. The script will generate an audio file containing the speech and play it using your system's default audio player.
